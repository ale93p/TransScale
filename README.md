# Transscale

---
Transscale is a dual-controller auto-scaler for streaming applications. It combines infrastructure scaling to algorithm
switching to reduce re-configuration times and resource utilisation.

It leverages on the principles of Transprecise Computing to dynamically decide _when_ and _where_ to apply the
approximated computation.
